        Microbiology is the study of the biology of microscopic organisms -
        viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds, and protozoa. The methods
        used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular
        organisms differ from those used in most other biological
        investigations. Recombinant DNA technology uses microorganisms,
        particularly bacteria and viruses, to amplify DNA sequences and generate
        the encoded products. Moving genes from one microorganism to another, or
        amplifying them within microorganisms, permits application of microbial
        skills to solve medical and environmental problems. Many microorganisms
        are unique among living things in their ability to use gaseous nitrogen
        from the air for their nutritional requirements, or to degrade complex
        macromolecules in such materials as wood. By rearranging the genes that
        control these and other processes, scientists seek to engineer
        microorganisms that will process wastes, fertilize agricultural land,
        produce desirable biomolecules, and solve other problems inexpensively
        and safely.

        Microbiologists pursue careers in many fields, including agricultural,
        environmental, food, and industrial microbiology; public health;
        resource management; basic research; education; and pharmaceuticals.
        Jobs in all of these fields are available at the BS level as well as the
        MS and PhD levels (see our guide for applying to graduate schools). The
        Microbiology major also incorporates the requirements expected for
        admission to medical, dental, and other health-professional schools, and
        to graduate schools in microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry,
        and related disciplines.
